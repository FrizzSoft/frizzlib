# **FrizzSoft**

## About FrizzSoft
**FrizzSoft** is the name I have given myself as a software developer.  Rather than putting my name on software I develop, I can use the name `FrizzSoft`.  It doesn't have a particular meaning, other than perhaps referring to the image of my hair standing on end when I'm trying to resolve a particularly difficult programing dilemma.
